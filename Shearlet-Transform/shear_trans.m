function d = shear_trans(x,pfilt,shear)
% This function generates the shearlet coefficients.
%
% Input :
%        x : input image
%        pfilt: name of filter for nuosubsampled LP (see atrousdec.m)
%        shear: cell array of directional shearing filters
%               (see shearing_filters_Myer.m).
%
% Output :
%        d : cell array of shearlet coefficients
